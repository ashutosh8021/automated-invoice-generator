# 🚀 Deployment Guide

## 📋 **Prerequisites for Deployment**

Your application works locally but needs proper configuration for deployment platforms like Netlify.

## 🔧 **Netlify Deployment Setup**

### **Step 1: Environment Variables**
In your Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to **Site Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add these variables:

```
SUPABASE_URL = https://ysdbashzhpwjoidmvbmr.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your-actual-supabase-anon-key
```

### **Step 2: Build Configuration**
The `netlify.toml` is configured to:
- Use the custom build script (`netlify-build.sh`)
- Replace environment placeholders during build
- Publish the correct Angular output directory

### **Step 3: Deploy**
1. **Push your changes** to GitHub (we've already done this)
2. **Connect repository** to Netlify
3. **Set environment variables** in Netlify dashboard
4. **Deploy** - Netlify will automatically use the build script

## 🐛 **Common Deployment Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: "Module not found"**
- **Cause**: Missing environment variables or build script failure
- **Fix**: Ensure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in Netlify

### **Issue 2: "Environment file missing"**
- **Cause**: `environment.prod.ts` was removed from Git
- **Fix**: Build script now creates it from the example template

### **Issue 3: "Build command failed"**
- **Cause**: Build script permissions or missing dependencies
- **Fix**: Netlify config now sets proper permissions (`chmod +x`)

## ✅ **What We Fixed**

1. **Enhanced build script** with error checking
2. **Proper Netlify configuration** using custom build command
3. **Environment file creation** from template during build
4. **Clear error messages** if environment variables are missing

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Deployment**

1. **Set environment variables** in Netlify dashboard
2. **Trigger a new deploy** (or push a small change)
3. **Check build logs** for any remaining issues

Your application should deploy successfully with these fixes! 🚀
